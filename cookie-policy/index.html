For example, we could show you advertisements for relevant publications or products and services if we know you have been browsing sections about related products or services on our sites. If you use more than one device or computer on a regular basis, we can link cookies together so that you can still receive a personalized online experience. We also personalize the information you see based on what already know about you or presume about you based on your online activities, so that you spend less time looking for things. With the use of cookies, each visitor to our site can have a web experience that is unique to them. Cookies can also be linked with other information we hold or presume about you for these purposes. For example, if you are a registered user or provide us with your name, email address, social media log-in details or other contact information (e.g. by entering a competition or signing up to our newsletter) or interact with our email communications (e.g. by clicking on links within the emails), this information can be linked with your browsing activity across all your devices to tailor content, services, advertising and offers for you. We also obtain information from third party service providers such as demographics and interest categories created from a combination of sources that permit us to provide you with more relevant and useful content, communications and advertising.

A web beacon (also called a web bug, clear GIF or pixel tag) can be embedded in online content, videos and emails, and allows a server to read certain types of information from your device, to know when you have viewed the beacon and the IP address of your device. The type of information collected includes, but is not limited to, information relating to advertising responses, page views, promotion views and purchases made. We will include web beacons in certain promotional email messages and newsletters to determine whether the messages have been opened or acted upon and whether our mailing tools are working correctly. The web beacons can be used to recognize cookies generated by third parties and inform us and third parties of which advertisement or link brought you to our site, allowing us to monitor the efficacy of our business relationships with third parties. </p></div><div _ngcontent-sc21="" class="mt-8"><div _ngcontent-sc21="" class="paragraph-title text-xl font-medium">How to manage or refuse cookies and similar technologies</div><p _ngcontent-sc21="" class="paragraph leading-relaxed"> If you do not want your browser to accept cookies and use them in the ways described above, you can change your browser settings.
